# Rememberbrall is
a little program which helps to remember interesting stuff. Mostly it is a learning project to further develop my programming skills. Technologies like Spring Boot 2, Spring REST Docs, Heroku, AssertJ and Webflux are used.

## The current build is
nice and green like always: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/evainga/rememberbrall.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/evainga/rememberbrall)
