= API documentation of Rememberbrall

This artifact holds integration tests for Rememberbrall and generates living documentation from them.
This is done with https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured[Rest Assured] and http://projects.spring.io/spring-restdocs[Spring REST Docs].

In the next chapters, different Controllers with their endpoints of Rememberbrall are being documented with their respective request and response semantics.
