= API documentation of Rememberbrall
Eva GÃ¶ttert

This artifact holds integration tests for Rememberbrall and generates living documentation from this program. In the next chapters, `de.rememberbrall.RememberbrallController` is being documented with its respective request and response semantics.

Additionally you can check out a Thymeleaf representation of all entries under link:/thymeleaf-entries[Rememberbrall Entries with Thymeleaf]
